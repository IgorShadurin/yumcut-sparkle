# Sparkle Video Generator

Sparkle overlays and sparkle footage already exist across the internet, but most of the pretty, transparent clips hide behind paywalls or awkward licensing. This project keeps things open so anyone can get the same glitter overlay magic without swiping a credit card first.

## What this project is about

- Create short video loops filled with drifting sparkles.
- Keep the background completely transparent so you can drop them onto any scene.
- Export everything as WebM files, which stay crisp while keeping file sizes tiny.
- Deliver ready-to-drop sparkle footage for intros, reels, ads, and hero shots.
- Make the clips work on social posts, product demos, stream overlays, or whatever canvas you already use.

If you are browsing the repo UI, there’s a sample sparkle loop playing on the right side—use it as a quick preview of the vibe.

## How to use it

1. Install the project and open it in your browser.
2. Use the simple controls to choose colors, density, and timing.
3. Click the render button and download the WebM file that shows up.
4. Drop the resulting WebM footage onto your favorite editor or platform and enjoy the shimmer.

## Why it matters

- Transparent videos remove the need for chroma-key tricks.
- WebM gives you high quality with a fraction of the size of GIFs or MP4s.
- Owning your own sparkle clips means you can update branding, change pacing, or remix the look whenever you like.
- Having a reusable glitter overlay pack on hand saves time hunting marketplaces or stock sites.

## Who this helps

- Video editors and motion designers who need quick sparkle footage for promo edits, reels, or lower-thirds.
- Streamers, VTubers, and content creators polishing overlay scenes without heavy After Effects work.
- Ecommerce sellers and product photographers adding shimmer to hero shots and lookbooks.
- Indie filmmakers and social marketers who need lightweight VFX assets for transparent background graphics.

## Next up

We’re continuing to study how people actually use sparkle overlays so we can add presets, lighten the UI wording even more, and keep the creative path as human-friendly as possible. Reach out if you try it somewhere interesting—we’d love to see it in action.
